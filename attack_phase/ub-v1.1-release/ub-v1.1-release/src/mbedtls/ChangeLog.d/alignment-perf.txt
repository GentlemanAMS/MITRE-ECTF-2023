Features
   * General performance improvements by accessing multiple bytes at a time.
     Fixes #1666.
   * Improvements to use of unaligned and byte-swapped memory, reducing code
     size and improving performance (depending on compiler and target
     architecture).
Changes
   * Mixed-endian systems are explicitly not supported any more.
