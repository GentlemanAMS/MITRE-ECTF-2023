//! This module contains traits to implement the BogoStack and error structs.
//!
//! ## BogoStack
//!
//! The BogoStack consists of three layers.
//! - The framing layer
//!     - The framing layer is responsible for turning a stream of data into frames. The BogoStack uses BogoFraming.
//!       See the [`framing`](lower_layers::framing) module for the traits and structs provided to facilitate the
//!       implementation of this layer.
//! - The encryption and integrity layer
//!     - This layer is responsible for providing secure and authenticated methods of transportation.
//!       Implementations of this part of the BogoStack are provided in the [`crypto`](lower_layers::crypto)
//!       module. See that module for more detail on the traits and structs provided for this layer.
//! - The application layer
//!     - The application layer is the layer responsible for incorporating the lower two layers together.
//!       There are no implementations provided on this layer, but one can easily put together types consisting
//!       of a secure channel primitive with a framing layer primitive to create a channel that conforms to the
//!       BogoStack.
